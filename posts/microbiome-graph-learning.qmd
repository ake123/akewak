Can we model microbial interactions as graphs? Absolutely.

In this post, I explore the idea of using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to study microbiome dynamics.

-   Nodes: microbial taxa
-   Edges: co-occurrence or correlation
-   Features: abundance, function, location

Using libraries like `torch` and `igraph`, this can reveal community structure and functional roles.
