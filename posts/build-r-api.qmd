In this post, I describe how I built a minimal R package to interface with an open data API.

## Motivation

Many public APIs lack R bindings. Wrapping them in functions using `httr2` and `jsonlite` makes them accessible for analysis.

## Steps

1. Use `usethis::create_package()`
2. Add API wrapper functions
3. Document with `roxygen2`
4. Publish to GitHub and document with `pkgdown`

This approach is scalable and reproducible.
