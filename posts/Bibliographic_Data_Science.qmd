The transformation of European book culture between 1500 and 1800 offers a remarkable window into the evolution of knowledge, language, and public discourse. Our ongoing research addresses this transformation by combining large-scale bibliographic metadata with systematic data analysis, building upon national bibliographies and extensive catalog collections.

At the heart of this work lies the concept of bibliographic data science: applying reproducible, quantitative methods to understand long-term publishing trends. By integrating millions of records from national libraries—including the Finnish and Swedish bibliographies, the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), and the Heritage of the Printed Book Database—we are creating an unprecedented foundation for historical research across Europe.

The scale of this project requires meticulous harmonisation of metadata, from standardising publication places and document formats to enriching missing information with external sources. This process enables researchers to trace the spread of publishing centres, the rise of vernacular languages, and material aspects such as book formats or paper consumption.

For example, our studies reveal how Finnish book production, which began modestly in Turku in 1640, expanded steadily during the Grand Duchy era under Russian rule. Similarly, we observe the significant role of octavo-format books in the 18th century, reflecting broader shifts toward portability and access to printed material. These developments were not isolated—they unfolded alongside major political and cultural changes, such as the introduction of freedom of print in Sweden (1766) or the foundation of universities across the region.

Beyond quantifying publication trends, our research addresses structural challenges in the bibliographical landscape. National bibliographies have traditionally operated within fragmented standards and cataloguing practices. By promoting open data, systematic quality monitoring, and shared analytical tools, we aim to create a more integrated, collaborative infrastructure that benefits both historical research and cultural heritage preservation.

This work contributes to the broader discussion on how digital resources, when handled with careful methodological control, can illuminate overlooked historical processes. It complements more qualitative scholarship by providing large-scale, verifiable perspectives on knowledge production—whether in early modern Europe or future global research efforts.
