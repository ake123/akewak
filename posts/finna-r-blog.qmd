The [Finna API](https://www.finna.fi/) gives access to rich cultural metadata from Finnish libraries and museums.

Using the `finna` R package, I queried metadata for:

- Books on the microbiome
- Music archives
- Local history collections

Combining `finna::search_finna()` with tidyverse tools made it easy to visualize and analyze trends.
