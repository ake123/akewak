Differential expression analysis is at the heart of modern omics research, helping scientists pinpoint proteins or genes that distinguish one condition from another, such as disease versus healthy states. However, analyzing complex proteomics datasets remains challenging, especially when experiments include technical variation, batch effects, or biological covariates like age and sex.

To address these challenges, our team developed LimROTS, an R/Bioconductor package that combines two powerful statistical approaches: the flexible linear modeling and empirical Bayes method from limma, and the reproducibility-optimized ranking from ROTS. This hybrid design allows LimROTS to handle complex experimental designs while improving the reliability of differential expression results.

In rigorous benchmarking using 21 gold standard proteomics datasets, LimROTS consistently outperformed widely used tools such as limma, ROTS, MSstats, DEqMS, DEP, SAM, ANOVA, and t-tests. We also tested LimROTS on real-world clinical data from Alzheimer's disease patients. The method identified biologically meaningful protein changes with improved precision, even in the presence of technical variability.

LimROTS is openly available through Bioconductor and is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing omics workflows. Its ability to manage complex designs and enhance reproducibility makes it a promising tool not only for proteomics but potentially for transcriptomics and metabolomics as well.
